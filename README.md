# Data Science Workflow for Housing Price Prediction

## Description
This repository contains a comprehensive data science workflow aimed at predicting housing prices. The project covers the entire process from data collection and cleaning to exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling.

## Key Features
- **Data Preparation**: Implementation of stratified sampling to ensure representative training and testing datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualization of geographical data and correlation analysis to identify key features influencing housing prices.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new attributes (e.g., rooms per household) and data transformations.
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Construction of a robust preprocessing pipeline using `ColumnTransformer` to streamline model training.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization library.
